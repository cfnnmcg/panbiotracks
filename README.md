# Panbiotracks

A set of scripts to do tracks analysis, LÃ©on Croizat's geometrical approach to biogeography. It is composed of three main components, one for individual tracks, one for generalized tracks and one for panbiogeographic nodes.

- `indtracks`: It builds an individual track from a list of locations in a comma-separated file (CSV) and saves the result to an ESRI shape file (SHP).
- `pseudogentracks`: It builds a pseudo-generalized track from a set of individual tracks and saves the result to an ESRI shape file (SHP).
- `nodes`: It identifies the intersections between a set of generalized tracks and marks each as a node, then saves the result to an ESRI shape file (SHP).

## Basic usage

### indtracks

```console
indtracks.py -i [LIST_OF_LOCATIONS.csv] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]
```

### pseudogentracks

```console
pseudogentracks.py -i [FILE_1.shp] [FILE_2.shp] [FILE_N.shp] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]
```

### nodes

```console
nodes.py -i [FILE_1.shp] [FILE_2.shp] [FILE_N.shp] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]
```
